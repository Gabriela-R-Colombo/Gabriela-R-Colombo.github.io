### My story

Hi! My name is Gabriela Colombo, and I am a Natural Resource Management Scientist with a passion for environmental research and geospatial technology. Much of my adult life has been shaped by my early childhood growing up in a rural beach town on the coast of Brazil, where I developed a deep curiosity for the natural world. This early connection to environmental systems led me to pursue a degree in Ecosystem Management and Forestry from the University of California, Berkeley.

My expertise spans geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and ecological data visualization. I have experience working with NASA's research programs and have contributed to significant environmental justice initiatives, particularly in understanding urban heat islands and their intersection with air quality issues.
